I am a PhD student in Information Systems at [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), University of Pennsylvania, where I am advised by [Kartik Hosanagar](https://www.hosanagar.com/).

My research examines the economics of human-AI collaboration through machine learning techniques and experimental methods, focusing on computational creativity, generative engine optimization, and agent collaboration. Using field experiments, large-scale data analysis, and quantitative marketing methods, I investigate how AI transforms creative processes, AI-mediated marketing, and systems design across industries. I leverage large language models and other AI systems to generate actionable insights for technology design and management strategy.

**Research Interests:**
- *Broad Interests:* Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Quantitative Marketing, Information Systems
- *Methods:* Bayesian Inference, Generative AI, Multimodal Machine Learning, Probabilistic Machine Learning
- *Applications:* AI and Creativity, Human-AI Collaboration, AI in Non-Cognitive Tasks, Generative Engine Optimization

I hold degrees in Computer Science, Business Administration, and an MBA.
